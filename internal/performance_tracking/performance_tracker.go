// This file contains code for tracking performance metrics of the IoT model and simulations.

// Prompt:
// - Define a struct to represent performance metrics, including metrics such as throughput, latency, and accuracy.
// - Implement functions for measuring and updating performance metrics during the execution of the program.
// - Provide interfaces for accessing and reporting performance metrics.
